# CT_data_processing_codes
These codes are used to sort clinical CT scans. Then load CT data, crop it, coarsen it, and save it as .mat files. These were designed to be used with GE CT scanners in the Stanford Department of Energy Resources Engineering but may work for other clinical CT files. First use 'move_ct_files' to sort scans into folders. Then use 'Raw_CT_FIJI_format_v2_git' to load, crop, and coarsen data. There are options to load data without coarsening or cropping data.
